# Collection functions

### [join: separator; list]

Prints the elements of a list in order separated by the `separator` value.

### [len: obj]

Prints the length of `obj` as an integer.

For strings, this is the number of bytes; for lists and maps, this is the number of elements.
All other value types give a length of 0.
