# Constructs

**Constructs** refer to special runtime objects that Rant can natively interact with to tailor the output of a program.
There are several construct types currently supported in Rant, which are divided into the following categories:

* [Block attributes](/constructs/block-attributes.md)
* [Formatters](/constructs/formatters.md)
* [Targets](/constructs/targets.md)
