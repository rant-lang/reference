# Constructs

**Constructs** are special runtime variables that Rant can natively interact with to tailor the output of a program.
There are several construct types currently supported in Rant, divided into the following categories:

* [Block attributes](/constructs/block-attributes.md)
* [Formatters](/constructs/formatters.md)
* [Targets](/constructs/targets.md)
