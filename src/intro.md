This documentation is a reference for the language features, standard library, and major runtime features of version 4.x of Rant.

## Philosophy

I firmly believe that all documentation should be:

1. **Easily understandable**: Concepts should be separated in a way that they are easily consumed and understood.
2. **Rapidly actionable**: Information and examples should be easy to adapt to your own needs without extensive background reading.

In pursuing these goals, this document is designed to act as both comprehensive reference documentation as well as a beginner's guide.

## Scope

This documentation is divided into the following chapters:

* [**Language features:**](/language.md) Overview of Rant as a language. 
* [**Runtime features:**](/runtime.md) Overview of features specific to the runtime.
* [**Standard library:**](/stdlib.md) Reference for the functions found in the Rant Standard Library.
* [**Glossary:**](/glossary.md) Familiarize yourself with Rant's terminology.
