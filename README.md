The future home of the Rant 4 language reference.

Disclaimer: This document is a work-in-progress and is not normative.

## Building

Building the reference requires `mdbook`, which is installed via Cargo with:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

Then build the book with:

```sh
mdbook build
```

The built book will be created in a `book` directory in the project root.
